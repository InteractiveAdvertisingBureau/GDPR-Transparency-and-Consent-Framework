# Introduction <a name="Introduction"></a>

In February 2017, the IAB Europe assembled parties representing both the supply and demand sides of the digital advertising ecosystem, to work collectively on guidance and solutions to the requirements of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).  That working group is known as the GDPR Implementation Working Group (GIG).  One of the sub-groups within the GIG was tasked with developing guidance on consent as a legal basis for processing personal data. Out of that effort, an additional working group was formed to develop a technical solution to the challenge of obtaining and disseminating consumer consent to the various parties relying on it as a legal basis of processing personal data.

## About the Transparency & Consent Framework <a name="About-the-Framework"></a>

The scope of the technical working group's initiative increased to include a technical industry solution to allow website operators to:
1.  Control the vendors they wish to allow to access their users' browsers (for setting and reading cookies) and process their personal data and disclose these choices to other parties in the online advertising ecosystem
2. Seek user consent under the ePrivacy Directive (for setting cookies or similar technical applications that access information on a device) and/or the GDPR in line with applicable legal requirements and signal the consent status through the online advertising ecosystem
 
In summary, have one place to go to:

* Understand privacy-related disclosures about those vendors

* Use those disclosures to make privacy-related disclosures to its users

* Disseminate the disclosure status through the online advertising ecosystem. 

The various pieces of the Framework are the following:

* A Global Vendor and CMP List (commonly referred to as the List)

* The technical specification for capturing, storing and retrieving user consent in the context of digital advertising

* Policy underlying the:

    * Disclosures to be made by vendors included on the List

    * Use of the List and the reference architecture

## About the Transparency & Consent Standard <a name="About-the-standard"></a>

Resources including policy FAQ, Global Vendor List Registration, and CMP registration can be found at [advertisingconsent.eu](http://advertisingconsent.eu/).

For purposes of this documentation, the following terms have the following definitions: 

* "**_CMP_**" means a company that can read the vendors chosen by a website operator and the consent status of an end user (either service specific (through a first-party cookie) or global (through a third-party cookie).  A CMP is not synonymous with a company that surfaces the user interface to a user (although it can be the same).

* "**_Purposes_**" mean the purposes for which a Controller enabled by a website operator is using personal data collected from (or received by a third party) about an end user.

* "**_Daisybit_**" means information compressed into a binary value and passed throughout the online advertising ecosystem through the OpenRTB specification.

* "**_Vendor_**" means a third party that a website operator is using in connection with surfacing content to its end users that either (1) accesses an end user's device or browser; and/or (2) collects or receives personal data about the website operator's end users.  As such, a vendor need not be a Controller.

# Consent string and vendor list format v1.1 <a name="Consent-string-and-vendor-list-format"></a>

## Version History <a name="Version-History"></a>

2018/04/24 - Version 1.1 final publication

2018/03/08 - Version 1.1 published for 30-day public comment

2017/12/19 - Initial version v1.0 created

## In the GDPR Global DaisyBit consent solution, what purpose does the consent string serve? <a name="in-the-GDPR-global-daisybit"></a>

After the interaction between an end user and the Consent Manager Provider (CMP) UI, the consent info is stored (for example, as a third-party cookie) in the user's browser. The data in the consent string answers the question: "Which vendors and purposes did the user give consent for?"

## What information is stored in the consent string? <a name="what-information-is-stored"></a>

The data stored in the consent string is divided into 3 parts:

1. Metadata of the consent info, e.g. consent string version, when updated, vendor list version, what compression scheme applied on the data.

2. What standard purposes (not per-vendor) the user has given consent for ([See Policy FAQ](http://advertisingconsent.eu/#resources)). 

3. What vendors the user gave consent to.

## What is not being supported in the consent string format? <a name="not-supported-consent-string"></a>

* Multiple vendor lists support (or regional lists)

* Intelligent handling of deleted vendors

* Distinct recording of "Consent Revoked" (as opposed to "No Consent")

* "Not yet consented" state per vendor (it's either "Consent" or "No Consent", or string-not-present).

* Legal audit trail within the consent string. However, the following details are stored for consent logging and audit record: LastUpdated, CmpId, CmpVersion, ConsentScreen, ConsentLanguage, and VendorListVersion.

## What is contained in the vendor list JSON? <a name="contained-in-vendor-list"></a>

* A vendor list version

* A list of standard purposes (identifies PurposesAllowed and StandardPurposesAllowed consent bits) ([See Policy FAQ for definitions.](http://advertisingconsent.eu/#resources))

* A list of standard features. Vendors can indicate that they use features. Since they span data purposes, they are not individually consentable-to by the user, but should be shown in the vendor details in the UI. 

* A list of vendors with assigned VendorIds, the standard purposes they are requesting consent for, the standard purposes they will be using legitimate interest for, and the URL of their GDPR policy page. VendorIds are incrementally-assigned and never reused; deleted vendors are just marked as deleted.

## What are the URLs for the vendor (and standard purposes) lists? <a name="URLs-vendorlist"></a>

The vendor list will be in JSON and hosted at [https://vendorlist.consensu.org/vendorlist.json](https://vendorlist.consensu.org/vendorlist.json) . Previous and the current version are available at [https://vendorlist.consensu.org/v-](https://vendorlist.consensu.org/vendorlist-versionnum.json)[*versionnum*/](https://vendorlist.consensu.org/vendorlist-versionnum.json)[vendorlist](https://vendorlist.consensu.org/vendorlist-versionnum.json)[.json](https://vendorlist.consensu.org/vendorlist-versionnum.json) , where *versionnum* is a decimal number from 0 to 4095 as indicated in the VendorListVersion field.

Translations of the standard purposes' names and descriptions to non-English languages will be contained in a JSON file including only the 'purposes', 'features', 'vendorListVersion', and 'lastUpdated' keys, and hosted at [https://vendorlist.](https://vendorlist.consensu.org/purposes-language.json)[consensu.org](https://vendorlist.consensu.org/purposes-language.json)[/purposes-](https://vendorlist.consensu.org/purposes-language.json)[*language*](https://vendorlist.consensu.org/purposes-language.json)[.json](https://vendorlist.consensu.org/purposes-language.json) with older versions at [https://vendorlist.consensu.org/v-](https://vendorlist.consensu.org/purposes-language-versionnum.json)*[versionnum*/](https://vendorlist.consensu.org/purposes-language-versionnum.json)[purposes-](https://vendorlist.consensu.org/purposes-language-versionnum.json)[*language*](https://vendorlist.consensu.org/purposes-language-versionnum.json)[.json](https://vendorlist.consensu.org/purposes-language-versionnum.json) where *language* is the two-letter lowercase ISO 639-1 language code.

## What is the process of getting on the global vendor list? <a name="process-vendorlist"></a>

Access [http://advertisingconsent.eu/](http://advertisingconsent.eu/) to register on the global vendor list. Registration guidelines are available on this website as well.

## What is the format of the global vendor (and standard purposes) list? <a name="format-vendorlist"></a>

Purposes, features, and vendors will be sorted by "id".

The JSON format is:

```
{
  "vendorListVersion": 0, // will be incremented each change*
  "lastUpdated": "2018-05-28T00:00:00Z",
  "purposes": [
    { 
      "id": 1,
      "name": "Storage and access of information",
      "description": "The storage of information, or access to information that is already stored, on user device such as accessing advertising identifiers and/or other device identifiers, and/or using cookies or similar technologies.."
    },
    // ... more purposes from id=2 to currently, id=5 (max, id=24)
  ],
  "features" : [
    {
      "id": 1
      "name": "Matching Data to Offline Sources",
      "description": "combining data from offline sources that were initially collected in other contexts"
    },
    // ... more purposes from id=2 up to no higher than id=64. Currently there are 3 planned features*
  ],
  "vendors": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "name": "Vendor Name",
      "purposeIds": [1], // list of consentable data purposes
      "legIntPurposeIds": [2, 3], // list of (non-consentable) data purposes that will be used under legitimate interest
      "featureIds": [1, 2], // list of features
      "policyUrl": "[https://vendorname.com/gdpr.html](https://vendorname.com/gdpr.html)",
      "deletedDate": "2018-05-28T00:00:00Z", // if present, vendor should be considered deleted after this date/time
    },
    // ... more vendors, expecting several hundred vendors in the initial Global Vendor List*
  ]
}
```

## What are the purposes and features being supported? <a name="purposes-features"></a>

The entries below are valid for the v1.1 release. Purposes and features are subject to change, so are included in the Global Vendor List. For most up-to-date policy defined purposes, please refer to [http://advertisingconsent.eu/#resources](http://advertisingconsent.eu/#resources). 

Purposes are individually-consentable data uses. Due to space constraints in the consent string, they are not consentable on a per-vendor basis, but which vendors utilize which purpose should be shown in the UI for each vendor. Consent for a purpose applies only to vendors that have declared (via the Global Vendor List) that they use that purpose.

Features are informational and should be shown on the UI as a data use by that vendor for transparency purposes, but since they can span multiple (consentable) purposes, they are not individually consentable.

## How is publisher-specific consent stored? <a name="publisher-consent-stored"></a>

Under this proposal, there are two types of publisher-specific consent: service-specific vendor consent, and a publisher's purposes consent for its own data use (if needed). For example, a publisher that wants to set a frequency-capping first-party cookie should request Publisher Purposes Consent for Purpose #1 "Accessing a Device".

Service-specific vendor consent can be implemented (optionally) by a CMP using the same Vendor Consent String Format (as detailed above) with the Host, Path, and/or Cookie Name referencing a first-party cookie (or service-shared 3rd-party cookie).  If a CMP allows a subset of vendors to be configured by a publisher, storage of consent in a service-specific cookie is necessary to avoid clearing previously-given consent (on non-included vendors) on the global cookie.

The following table indicates which fields are used by which cookie:

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>Consent String Format Type</td>
    <td>Cookie Location</td>
    <td>Purpose</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Vendor Consent</td>
    <td>3rd-party global location
(.consensu.org). Required cookie name: euconsent</td>
    <td>global vendor consent</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Vendor Consent</td>
    <td>1st-party publisher-configured name & location. Could instead be a 3rd-party shared location, for a service-specific cookie that spans publisher sites. Recommended default cookie name: euconsent</td>
    <td>service-specific vendor consent </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Publisher Purposes Consent</td>
    <td>1st-party publisher-configured name & location (again, could be a shared 3rd-party location as well). Recommended default cookie name: eupubconsent</td>
    <td>publisher's own data usages consent (not looked at by vendors)</td>
  </tr>
</table>


A publisher's purposes consent string stores the publisher's own consent. This is different than the consent string used to collect consumer consent for vendors. The publisher can configure the CMP to request consent for any of the standard list of purposes (which utilizes the StandardPurposesAllowed bitfield and the standard list of purposes from the Vendor List) and/or custom purposes (initialized by the publisher). 

Differences from the Vendor Consent String Format are:

* "PublisherPurposesVersion" augments "VendorListVersion" and is incremented each time the publisher modifies the requested purposes.

* "NumCustomPurposes" replaces "MaxVendorId" and is reduced to 6 bits.

* "BitField" encoding is always used and is indexed by CustomPurposeId's.

* Host, Path, and Cookie Name are configured in the CMP by the publisher, and the consent string data is stored as a first-party cookie by the CMP javascript.

### Publisher Purposes Consent String Format <a name="publisher-purposes-consent-string-format"></a>

The following fields are stored in big-endian format, the binary bits padded at the end with zeroes to the nearest multiple of 8 bits, packed into a string of bytes, and [base64url-encoding](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4648#section-5) performed (with '=' padding omitted).
