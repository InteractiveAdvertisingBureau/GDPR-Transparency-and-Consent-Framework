## Introduction

This document is one of the IAB Europe Transparency and Consent Framework Specifications. It defines the technical implementation of the structure and encoding for a Transparency and Consent String (TC String), and the format for a [Global Vendor List (GVL)](#the-global-vendor-list) maintained by IAB Europe. The TC String is a technical component of the IAB Europe Transparency & Consent Framework (TCF).

The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) requires a high level of accountability for how personal data is processed. While important to all parties in the digital advertising ecosystem, implementation of the GDPR came with heavy technical challenges.

The GDPR requires, amongst others, a legal basis for such processing. The two most relevant legal bases are the consent of the user to the processing of their personal data, and the legitimate interests of the controller or a third party to the processing of a user’s personal data, provided that the interests and fundamental rights of the user are not overriding. Both legal bases require the provision of disclosures to ensure transparency, and the opportunity for user choice either through the user’s consent to the processing of their personal data before the processing starts if the legal basis is consent, or through the user’s objection to the processing of their personal data after the processing starts if the legal basis is a legitimate interest. Under the GDPR, controllers are required to create and maintain records of compliance, including, but not limited to user consent records. This warrants clear standards for a common technical solution for all affected parties and policies to govern how that solution is used.

IAB Europe established the TCF to support compliance with the GDPR in the context of digital advertising. This framework is built on four components: a [Global Vendor List (GVL)](#the-global-vendor-list), a Transparency and Consent String (TC String), an API for Consent Management Providers (CMPs) to create and process the TC String, and the Policies that govern how the TCF is used.

Prescribed use of the TCF may support compliance with the GDPR, but the real benefit to the digital advertising ecosystem is a safer Internet for consumers, and more reliable data for brands and publishers. As adoption of the TCF increases, compliance becomes more scalable and data becomes more meaningful.

To participate in the use of the TCF, vendors must make a public attestation of compliance with the [Policies](https://iabeurope.eu/iab-europe-transparency-consent-framework-policies/) for using it. To have transparency and consent established and signaled status for your online services stored in a global database, apply to be added to the [GVL](#the-global-vendor-list). To play a role in creating a TC String for signaling status on transparency and user consent, sign up with IAB Europe to become a CMP. CMPs must follow technical standards provided in this document for creating TC Strings in compliance with TCF [Policies](https://iabeurope.eu/iab-europe-transparency-consent-framework-policies/). They must also follow technical standards guidance for using the CMP API specified in this document to receive and process information provided in a TC String.

### Audience

Engineers for a registered CMP can use this document to design or update a solution for generating a TC String. In particular, first parties (content publishers, advertisers, and other suppliers of online services) and third-party (vendors for data-driven services) organisations should be familiar with the purpose and scope of a TC String as well as what information it provides, and support its implementation.

### About the Transparency & Consent Framework

IAB Europe Transparency & Consent Framework (TCF) has a simple objective to help all parties in the digital advertising chain ensure that they comply with the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation and ePrivacy Directive when processing personal data or accessing and/or storing information on a user’s device, such as cookies, advertising identifiers, device identifiers and other tracking technologies. IAB Tech Lab stewards the development of these technical specifications.

## About the Transparency & Consent String (TC String)

In the TCF, a TC String is used to encapsulate relevant details about how transparency and consent was established and encoded as it applies for each of the Purposes, Special Purposes, Features, and Special Features defined by the [Policies](https://iabeurope.eu/iab-europe-transparency-consent-framework-policies/) and for participating Vendors. This document specifies how that string must be formatted, who should use it, and how it must be used.



### Definitions

Regarding specific definitions as they relate to TCF [Policies](https://iabeurope.eu/iab-europe-transparency-consent-framework-policies/) and the technology described in this document, please refer to IAB Europe Transparency and Consent Framework Policies located at the following link:

[https://iabeurope.eu/iab-europe-transparency-consent-framework-policies/](https://iabeurope.eu/iab-europe-transparency-consent-framework-policies/)



 ### What purpose does a TC String serve?

A TC String’s primary purpose is to encapsulate and encode all the information disclosed to a user and the expression of their preferences for their personal data processing under the GDPR. Using a Consent Management Platform (CMP), the information is captured into an encoded and compact  HTTP-transferable string. This string enables communication of transparency and consent information to entities, or “vendors”, that process a user's personal data. Vendors decode a TC String to determine whether they have the necessary legal bases to  process a user's personal data for their purposes. The concise string data format enables a  CMP to persist and retrieve a user’s preferences any time they're needed as well as transfer that information to any vendors who need it.


### What information is stored in a TC String?

A TC String contains the following information:



1. **General metadata:** standard markers that indicate details about a TC String such as its encoding version, when it was last updated, and when it was initially created as well as details about the conditions of the transparency and consent values it contains such as the [Global Vendor List](#the-global-vendor-list) version used, the CMP used, etc.
2. **User consent:** a user’s expression of consent given for processing their personal data. A user’s consent is expressed on two levels: per Purpose and per Vendor.
3. **Legitimate interest:** the record of a CMP having established legitimate interest transparency for a vendor and/or purpose and whether the user exercised their “Right to Object” to it.  This includes signals for Purposes in general and Purposes declared specifically for a given Vendor.
4. **Publisher restrictions:** the restrictions of a vendor's data processing by a publisher within the context of the users trafficking their digital property.
5. **Publisher transparency and consent:** a segment of a TC String that publishers may use to establish transparency with and receive consent from users for their own legal bases to process personal data or to share with vendors if they so choose.
6. **Specific jurisdiction disclosures:** the country in which the publisher’s business entity is established or the legislative country of reference and a record of whether Purpose 1, “[to] store and/or access information on a device,” was disclosed to the user since some jurisdictions handle this Purpose differently.


### Who should create a TC string?

A Transparency & Consent String may only be created by an IAB Europe TCF registered CMP using its assigned CMP ID number in accordance with the [Policies](https://iabeurope.eu/iab-europe-transparency-consent-framework-policies/). Vendors or any other third-party service providers must neither create nor alter TC Strings. These and other requirements are articulated in the [Policies](https://iabeurope.eu/iab-europe-transparency-consent-framework-policies/) to which all parties including CMPs, Publishers, and Vendors, are bound.


### When should a TC string be created?

A TC String that contains positive consent signals must not be created before clear affirmative action is taken by a user that unambiguously signifies that user’s consent. However, a TC String may be created with only legitimate interest establishment signals providing that legitimate interest transparency has been established in accordance with the [Policies](https://iabeurope.eu/iab-europe-transparency-consent-framework-policies/).


### What is the scope for a TC String?

CMPs must operate in a **service-specific** or group-specific configuration. A TC String in this context is applicable only on a service or group of services, for example the site(s) or app(s) on which it is running. One is created for every user on a given site/app or group of sites/apps. They may contain _**[Publisher restrictions](#what-are-publisher-restrictions)**_ and a _**[Publisher TC](#publisher-purposes-transparency-and-consent)**_ segment when returned by the CMP API.


### What happened to Global Scope and Out of Band?

The TCF Policy previously allowed legal bases in the Framework to be established with global scope, which means a legal basis is not only applicable on the service or group of services (service-specific and group-specific scopes) where it is obtained and managed, but all services implementing global scope preferences. In the context of global scope, TC Strings were stored in a 3rd party cookie associated with the “consensu.org” domain that enabled Consent Management Providers (CMPs) to read the “TC strings from their subdomains [cmp-name].mgr.consensu.org across different services. Deprecation of global-scope support was announced on June 22nd 2021. Alongside the deprecation of global scope, support for Out-of-Band (OOB)&mdash;which refers to instances where a legal basis has not been established using the TCF in a global-scope context&mdash;was also deprecated. Since Sept 1st 2021, TC strings established with global-scope are considered invalid.


### What are publisher restrictions?

Version 2.0 of the Framework introduced the ability for publishers to signal restrictions on how vendors may process personal data. Restrictions can be of two types:

*  **Purposes.** Restrict the purposes for which personal data is processed by a vendor.
*  **Legal basis.** Specify the legal basis upon which a publisher requires a vendor to operate where a vendor has signaled flexibility on legal basis in the [GVL](#the-global-vendor-list).

Publisher restrictions are custom requirements specified by a publisher. In order for vendors to determine if processing is permissible at all for a specific purpose or which legal basis is applicable (in case they signaled flexibility in the [GVL](#the-global-vendor-list)) restrictions must be respected.

1. Vendors must always respect a restriction signal that disallows them the processing for a specific purpose regardless of whether or not they have declared that purpose to be “flexible”.
2. Vendors that declared a purpose with a default legal basis (consent or legitimate interest respectively) but also declared this purpose as flexible must respect a legal basis restriction if present. That means for example in case they declared a purpose as legitimate interest but also declared that purpose as flexible and there is a legal basis restriction to require consent, they must then check for the consent signal and must not apply the legitimate interest signal.

For the avoidance of doubt:

In case a vendor has declared flexibility for a purpose and there is no legal basis restriction signal it must always apply the default legal basis under which the purpose was registered aside from being registered as flexible. That means if a vendor declared a purpose as legitimate interest and also declared that purpose as flexible it may not apply a "consent" signal without a legal basis restriction signal to require consent.   

### How does a URL-based service process the TC string when it can't execute JavaScript?

When a creative is rendered, it may contain a number of pixels under `<img>` tags. For example, `<img src="http://vendor-a.com/key1=val1&key2=val2">` which fires an HTTP GET request from the browser to Vendor A’s domain.

Since the pixel is in an `<img>` tag without the ability to execute JavaScript, the CMP API cannot be used to obtain the TC String.  All parties in the ad supply chain who transact using URLs must add a macro in their URLs where the TC String is inserted. Any caller with access to the applicable TC String must insert it within a URL containing the macro `${GDPR_CONSENT_XXXXX}` where `XXXXX` is the numeric Vendor ID of the vendor receiving the TC string.

For example, for Vendor A with ID 123 to receive a TC String, an image URL must include a key-value pair with the URL parameter and macro `gdpr_consent=${GDPR_CONSENT_123}`.

The resulting URL is:

`http://vendor-a.com/key1=val1&key2=val2&gdpr_consent=${GDPR_CONSENT_123}`

If the TC String is: `COvFyGBOvFyGBAbAAAENAPCAAOAAAAAAAAAAAEEUACCKAAA.IFoEUQQgAIQwgIwQABAEAAAAOIAACAIAAAAQAIAgEAACEAAAAAgAQBAAAAAAAGBAAgAAAAAAAFAAECAAAgAAQARAEQAAAAAJAAIAAgAAAYQEAAAQmAgBC3ZAYzUw`

 Then the caller replaces the macro in the URL with the actual TC String so that the originally placed pixel containing the macro is modified as follows when making the call to the specified server.

`http://vendor-a.com/key1=val1&key2=val2&gdpr_consent=COvFyGBOvFyGBAbAAAENAPCAAOAAAAAAAAAAAEEUACCKAAA.IFoEUQQgAIQwgIwQABAEAAAAOIAACAIAAAAQAIAgEAACEAAAAAgAQBAAAAAAAGBAAgAAAAAAAFAAECAAAgAAQARAEQAAAAAJAAIAAgAAAYQEAAAQmAgBC3ZAYzUw`

TC Strings must always be propagated as is, and not modified. Additional URLs in the supply chain are addressed the same way with remaining vendors.

The available URL parameters and macros to relay information down the supply chain are listed in the following section.

#### Full TC String passing

Services that are called using a URL from the user's browser, like cookie staplers, user id associators, and tracking pixels (the 'callee') are passed as macros within the URL and formatted as:

```
&url_parameter=${macro_name}
```

The supported URL parameters and the corresponding macros are defined below:


<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>URL parameter</strong></td>
      <td><strong>Corresponding Macro</strong></td>
      <td><strong>Representation in URL</strong></td>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><code>gdpr</code></td>
      <td><code>GDPR</code></td>
      <td><code>&gdpr=${GDPR}</code></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>gdpr_consent</code></td>
      <td>
        <code>GDPR_CONSENT_XXXXX</code>
        <p>
          (<code>XXXXX</code> is numeric Vendor ID - the ID of the vendor on
          the <a href="#the-global-vendor-list">GVL</a> who is expecting
          this URL call)
        </p>
      </td>
      <td>
        <code>&gdpr_consent=${GDPR_CONSENT_XXXXX}</code>
        <p>
          E.g. <code>&gdpr_consent=${GDPR_CONSENT_123}</code> for Vendor ID
          123.
        </p>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>gdpr_pd</code></td>
      <td><code>GDPR_PD</code></td>
      <td><code>&gdpr_pd=${GDPR_PD}</code></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>


The service making the call must replace the macros with appropriate values described in the table below. For macro `${GDPR_CONSENT_XXXXX}`, the service making the call must also check that the macro name contains a valid Vendor ID before replacing the macro. The creator of the URL should ensure these parameters are added only once, and are passed to services which are expecting them and can handle them properly.


<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Macro</strong></td>
      <td><strong>possible values</strong></td>
      <td><strong>purpose</strong></td>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><code>${GDPR}</code></td>
      <td><code>0</code> / <code>1</code></td>
      <td>
        <code>0</code> GDPR does not apply; <code>1</code> GDPR applies. If
        not present, callee should do geoIP lookup, and GDPR applies for EU
        IP addresses
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>${GDPR_CONSENT_XXXXX}</code></td>
      <td>
        URL-safe base64-encoded Transparency & Consent string. Only
        meaningful if <code>gdpr=1</code>
      </td>
      <td>
        Encodes the TC string, as obtained from the CMP JS API or OpenRTB.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>${GDPR_PD}</code></td>
      <td>
        <code>0</code> / <code>1</code> (optional, default: <code>1</code>)
      </td>
      <td>
        for generic URL parameters, <code>gdpr_pd=0</code> indicates none of
        them contain personal data (from the perspective of the callee). For
        "defined" URL parameters, their definition should define whether
        they include personal data.
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

**Note:** other personal data, like IP addresses or callee cookies, may be passed as part of the request, and the `gdpr` and `gdpr_consent_xxxxx` is used by the callee to determine whether an identifier cookie or other personal data can be set and/or used.

### What if consent is governed differently in a country?

[Policies](https://iabeurope.eu/iab-europe-transparency-consent-framework-policies/) require consent for Purpose 1 to store and/or access information on a device  “where such consent is necessary” leaving the responsibility to publishers and vendors to determine if consent in those jurisdictions is required or not.

 If a publisher is operating a CMP within a jurisdiction that does not require consent to store and/or access information on a device and, therefore, does not ask for consent on behalf of a vendor for a purpose 1, the CMP will write the corresponding bit in the _**PurposesConsent**_ field to `0`. Even though it is valid within that jurisdiction to not request consent for Purpose 1, a vendor would interpret that `0` as a “no consent” signal and have no way of knowing that consent was not required in the jurisdiction in which the publisher operates.  This lack of transparency would, ultimately, cause losses in ad revenue for that publisher.

To accommodate cases where Purpose 1 is governed differently for consent depending on the jurisdiction, a TC String is transparent about the publisher’s operating governance and whether or not Purpose 1 was disclosed to a user. The vendor can then use these details to make a determination about whether they have sufficient legal bases for personal data processing in that given context. To support this, there are two fields in a TC String: _**PublisherCC**_, which represents the publisher’s country code and a flag for whether any disclosure has been offered on Purpose 1 named _**PurposeOneTreatment**_. Details for each field are listed among [the fields used in the TC String](#tc-string-format).

### What happened to Created and LastUpdated?

The Created and LastUpdated fields previously corresponded to decisecond timestamps. Considering practical guidance from DPAs relating to the the various means that can be employed by data controllers to provide evidence of the consent obtained and its validity and the limited relevance of the Created field for publishers and their CMPs to fulfill the requirements of remaining users of their choices, as appropriate and at least every 13 months, the Created and LastUpdated fields have been updated to have the **same value** corresponding to the **day-level timestamp** of when the TC String was last updated.

## Creating a TC String

The following details provide information on creating, storing, and managing a TC String.

### How should a Transparency & Consent String be stored?

In version 2 of the TCF Specifications, the storage mechanism used for service-specific and group-specific TC Strings is up to a CMP, including any non-cookie storage mechanism.

### What are the Purposes and Features being supported?

The IAB Europe Transparency & Consent Framework [Policies](https://iabeurope.eu/iab-europe-transparency-consent-framework-policies/) defines Purposes, Special Purposes, Features, Special Features, and Stacks (groupings of Purposes and/or Special Features). You can reference the details of these purposes and features in the document found at the following URL:

[https://iabeurope.eu/iab-europe-transparency-consent-framework-policies/](https://iabeurope.eu/iab-europe-transparency-consent-framework-policies/)

#### Managing conflicting string versions

Post 30 September 2020, [v1.x strings were considered invalid](https://iabeurope.eu/all-news/the-iab-europe-transparency-consent-framework-tcf-steering-group-votes-to-extend-technical-support-for-tcf-v1-1/). If a CMP encounters a situation where both a v1.x string and a v2.0 string are erroneously present simultaneously, the CMP should remove the v1.x string to ensure that there is only one source of truth for consumers of the string.

Note: TCF version 2.0 introduces [“Publisher Restrictions”](#what-are-publisher-restrictions), which, if exhausted by a publisher, could result in TC strings that are larger than the size limit for cookies. While this possibility is remote, it should be guarded against – a CMP should work with a publisher to help them accomplish their goals. CMPs may need to take this into consideration when deciding on the storage mechanism for those TC Strings.


### TC String Format

There are 3 distincts TC String segments that are joined together on a “dot” character.  They are:

*   The core vendor transparency and consent details

        <p>Vendors must always respect a <code>0</code> (Not Allowed)
        regardless of whether or not they have not declared that Purpose to
        be “flexible”. Values <code>1</code> and <code>2</code> are in
        accordance with a vendor's declared flexibility. Eg. if a vendor has
        Purpose 2 declared as Legitimate Interest but also declares that
        Purpose as flexible and this field is set to <code>1</code>, they
        must then check for the “consent” signal in the VendorConsents
        section to make a determination on whether they have the legal basis
        for processing user personal data under that Purpose.</p>
        <p>When a vendor's Purpose registration <strong><em>is not flexible</em></strong> 
        they should interpret this value in the following ways:</strong></p>
        <p>If this value is <code>1</code> and vendor is registered under 
        Legitimate Interest for that Purpose then the vendor <em>should not 
        process</em> for that Purpose.</p>
        <p>If this value is <code>1</code> and vendor is registered under Consent
        for that Purpose then the vendor <em>can ignore</em> the signal.</p>
        <p>If this value is <code>2</code> and vendor is registered under Consent 
        for that Purpose then the vendor <em>should not process</em> for that Purpose.</p>
        <p>If this value is <code>2</code> and vendor is registered under 
        Legitimate Interest for that Purpose then the vendor <em>can ignore</em> the signal.</p>
        <p>If this value is <code>1</code> or <code>2</code> and the vendor is not
        registered for the Purpose then the vendor <em>should not process</em> for that Purpose.</p>

          registered as a consent purpose and can not be flexible per

#### Disclosed Vendors

The _**DisclosedVendors**_ is an optional TC String segment that records which vendors have been disclosed to a given user by a CMP. It may be used by a CMP while [storing](#how-should-a-transparency--consent-string-be-stored) TC Strings, but must not be included in the TC String when returned by the CMP API.

#### Publisher Purposes Transparency and Consent

Publishers may need to establish transparency and consent for a set of personal data processing purposes for their own use. For example, a publisher that wants to set a frequency-capping first-party cookie should request user consent for Purpose 1 "Store and/or access information on a device" in jurisdictions where it is required.

The _**[Publisher TC](#publisher-purposes-transparency-and-consent)**_ segment in the TC string represents the publisher's own transparency & consent signals and is separated from the general TC String segments. This segment supports the standard list of purposes defined by the TCF as well as Custom Purposes defined by the publisher if they so choose. Vendors should not rely on the _**[Publisher TC](#publisher-purposes-transparency-and-consent)**_ segment unless they're in agreement with the publisher to do so.

## The Global Vendor List

The Global Vendor List (GVL) is a technical document that CMPs download from a domain managed and published by IAB Europe. It lists all registered and approved Vendors, as well as standard Purposes, Special Purposes, Features, Special Features and Stacks. The information stored in the GVL is used for determining what legal disclosures must be made to the user.

### I’m a vendor, how do I get added to the Global Vendor List?

The registration process is described here: [https://iabeurope.eu/tcf](https://iabeurope.eu/tcf)

### What is contained in the Global Vendor List?

*   A Global Vendor List Specification Version
*   A Global Vendor List version
*   A TCF Policy Version
*   A Last Updated Date
*   A list of standard Purposes
*   A list of Special Purposes
*   A list of standard Features
*   A list of Special Features.
*   A list of Stacks
*   A list of Vendors and their:
    *   Numeric ID which is incrementally assigned and never re-used – deleted Vendors are just marked as deleted.
    *   Name.
    *   List of Purposes for which they are requesting consent.
    *   List of Purposes for which they require to be transparently disclosed as their legitimate interest.
    *   List of Purposes they have the flexibility to either use a consent or a legitimate interest legal basis.
    *   List of Special Purposes to transparently disclose as their legitimate interest that a user has no right to object.
    *   List of Features they use across Purposes.
    *   List of Special Features they use across Purposes.
    *   GDPR/privacy policy page URL.
    *   HTTP “overflow” options which includes a <code>GET</code> request maximum size in kilobytes to help diagnose problems with TC String passing as well as limit oversized strings.


### Where can I access the Global Vendor List?

The GVL is in JSON format and the current version at any given time can be retrieved using the following URL structure:

[https://vendor-list.consensu.org/v2/vendor-list.json](https://vendor-list.consensu.org/v2/vendor-list.json)

Previous versions of the Global Vendor List are available here:

[https://vendor-list.consensu.org/v2/archives/vendor-list-v{vendor-list-version}.json](https://vendor-list.consensu.org/v2/archives/vendorlist-v{vendor-list-version}.json)

Where ‘vendor-list-version’ corresponds to the ‘vendorListVersion’ property in the GVL, for example, the following URL would retrieve the GVL update published with version 138

https://vendor-list.consensu.org/v2/archives/vendor-list-v138.json

Previous versions of the GVL may only be used in cases when the current version cannot be downloaded (such as when operating in-app while offline), or for change control management.

**IMPORTANT NOTE**: the original vendorlist.consensu.org domain has been decommissioned on January 31st 2021. The new domain for GVL resources is vendor-list.consensu.org.

### TCF version 1 of the Global Vendor List (deprecated)

For reference, the URL for version 1 of the TCF was:

[https://vendorlist.consensu.org/vendorlist.json](https://vendorlist.consensu.org/vendorlist.json)

Version 1 of the Global Vendor List and all version 1 archives will continue to be maintained until support officially ends in 2020. At that time, these files will be deprecated and only version 2 and newer of the Global Vendor List will be available.

### Translations for Purposes, Special Purposes, Features, and Special Features

Translations of the names and descriptions for Purposes, Special Purposes, Features, and Special Features to non-English languages are contained in a file where attributes containing English content (except vendor declaration information) are translated, and can be found here:

https://vendor-list.consensu.org/v2/purposes-{language}.json

Where ‘language’ is a two letter lowercase [ISO 639-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_639-1) language code. Supported languages are listed at the following URL:

[https://register.consensu.org/Translation](https://register.consensu.org/Translation)

### How often is the Global Vendor List updated?

As of the publication of this document, changes to the Global Vendor List are published weekly at 5:00 PM Central European Time on Thursdays. IAB Europe reserves the right to change this time and will notify CMP members of any changes.

### CMPs using the GVL

CMPs must use the **latest** available version of the GVL whenever the interface is surfaced to the user to provide transparency or request consent. This condition applies to first-time and renewal interactions, as well as interactions that involve reviewing and updating settings.

In some cases, due to caching requirements and low connectivity environments, such as for mobile in-app experiences, it may not be possible to use the latest version of the GVL:

* For a delay caused by caching requirements, the penultimate version of the GVL may be considered the latest available version.
* For a delay caused by a lack of connectivity, the last cached version of the GVL may be used but must be updated as soon as connectivity is restored.

To determine whether the interface should be resurfaced to a user, the CMP must compare the latest version of the GVL with the archived version of the GVL identified in the TC String (assuming they are different). The CMP is not required to resurface the interface to the user if the versions are different. The timing and reasons for resurfacing the interface to users is at the discretion of the CMP and the publisher.

**Strict restrictions on accessing and caching the GVL apply and are detailed below.**

### Vendors using the GVL

Vendors must use the version of the GVL encoded in the TC String received to:

* Determine if they have the legal bases they need to process the user's personal data.
* Determine if any vendor they are about to pass personal data to, also has the necessary legal bases to process personal data.

**Strict restrictions on accessing and caching the GVL apply and are detailed below.**

### Accessing and caching the Global Vendor List

In TCF v1 it was possible for client-side CMP applications to load the GVL directly via CORS. Given the scale of the TCF and the high volume of requests for the Global Vendor List, this is no longer possible from TCF v2.0 onward. All requests for the GVL must now be server-side.

Current and previous GVL resources, as well as purpose translations, are configured with [cache-control headers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Cache-Control). Server-side applications must cache these resources in the same way that a browser would - the file must be requested and cached using the specified ```max-age``` value in the header. Once the cache expires, the resource can be requested again. Resources must not be cached for a period other than ```max-age```.

Previous versions of the GVL must be cached for at least the period specified by the cache-control headers and may be cached indefinitely as they are static resources.

### CMPs accessing and caching the GVL

Client-side CMP applications must not load GVL resources directly from vendor-list.consensu.org - instead they must be loaded and hosted by a CMP’s server-side application and then passed to the client-side CMP application.

As stated above, CMP server-side applications must cache these resources in the same way that a browser would. For example, if the ```max-age``` value in the header is one week, the server-side application must do the following:

* Request a GVL resource
* Cache the resource for one week
* When the cache expires after one week, clear the cache if necessary and re-request the resource

**Important:** The volume of usage will be monitored carefully by the managing organisation and any CMP not adhering to this request limit will be blocked from accessing the GVL.

To prevent client-side applications from repeatedly downloading files, CMPs should set cache-control headers on HTTP responses sent to client-side requests for their self-hosted GVL resources. This will ensure that browsers automatically cache the resources, circumventing the need to repeatedly request files over HTTP.

### Vendors accessing and caching the GVL

Vendor requests for GVL resources must be loaded and cached by the server-side application.

As stated above, vendor server-side applications must cache these resources in the same way that a browser would. For example, if the ```max-age``` value in the header is one week, the server-side application must do the following:

* Request a GVL resource
* Cache the resource for one week
* When the cache expires after one week, clear the cache if necessary and re-request the resource

**Important:** The volume of usage will be monitored carefully by the managing organisation and any vendor not adhering to this request limit will be blocked from accessing the GVL.

#### Using a compressed version of the Global Vendor List

In order to control the bandwidth used by requests for the GVL file, vendors and CMPs must request a compressed version of the GVL. This can be done by sending `Accept-Encoding` headers on the `GET` request for the file.

**Example:**

```
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate, br
```


A browser will add this header automatically and, therefore, nothing needs to be done for an in-browser request.  Server-side requests are another matter because server software may not decompress the response automatically. Make sure your server requests send the options your service is capable of decoding in your `Accept-Encoding` header.


#### Global Vendor List and TCF Policy Updates

When a change occurs in the TCF [Policies](https://iabeurope.eu/iab-europe-transparency-consent-framework-policies/), the update invalidates the previous declarations of vendors listed on the previous version of the GVL. These policy changes happen infrequently, but when they do, a CMP is required to discard the user’s current TC String and resurface the user interface to provide new disclosures, capture new consent, and encode a new TC String without migrating any old values over from the old one.

To determine if TCF [Policies](https://iabeurope.eu/iab-europe-transparency-consent-framework-policies/) have changed, CMPs shall compare the _**TcfPolicyVersion**_ encoded in a TC String with the _**TcfPolicyVersion**_ property in the latest Global Vendor List published by the Managing Organisation – if the values are different then the TCF Policy has changed and a CMP will be required to provide new disclosures, capture new consent, and encode a new TC String.


### Example Global Vendor List JSON Object

Here is an annotated example of the GVL’s JSON format:

```javascript
{
  "gvlSpecificationVersion": 2,
  "vendorListVersion": 133, // incremented with each published file change
  "tcfPolicyVersion": 2, // The TCF MO will increment this value whenever a GVL change (such as adding a new Purpose or Feature or a change in Purpose wording) legally invalidates existing TC Strings and requires CMPs to re-establish transparency and consent from users. TCF Policy changes should be relatively infrequent and only occur when necessary to support changes in global mandate. If the policy version number in the latest GVL is different from the value in your TC String, then you need to re-establish transparency and consent for that user. A version 1 format TC String is considered to have a version value of 1.

## Global CMP List Specification
The Global CMP List (GCL) is a JSON format document that lists all CMPs registered with the Transparency and Consent Framework (TCF). There are separate files for v1.1 and v2 of the framework. These files are used by vendors to determine which CMPs are compliant and active within the framework, in order to ascertain whether a given CMP ID found in a consent string or TC String is valid.

IMPORTANT NOTE: all CMPs that have registered with the TCF are listed in these files. CMPs that are no longer active for whatever reason, have the `deletedDate` property set. Consent strings or TC Strings for CMPs with a `deletedDate` set must be considered invalid after that date/time and must be discarded immediately and not passed downstream.

### What is contained in the Global CMP List?
* A Last Updated Date.
* A list of CMPs detailing:
  * A Numeric ID which is incrementally assigned and never re-used - inactive CMPs are marked as deleted.
  * Their Name.
  * Whether or not the CMP is a commercial service.
  * If applicable, the date/time after which CMP is considered inactive.

### Where can I access the Global CMP List?
The GCL is in JSON format and the current version at any given time can be retrieved using the following URL:

v2: https://cmplist.consensu.org/v2/cmp-list.json
v1: https://cmplist.consensu.org/cmp-list.json

### How often is the Global CMP List updated?
As of the publication of this document, changes to the Global CMP List are published weekly at 5:00 PM Central European Time on Thursdays. IAB Europe reserves the right to change this time and will notify members of any changes.

### Caching the Global CMP List
Strict restrictions on caching the GCL apply.

All requests for the Global CMP List must honour the cache-control headers and must not cache the resource with different settings.

Note: There may be a delay of up to the maximum cache interval in retrieving the latest version of the Global CMP List.

### Server-side caching of the GCL
As requests for a GCL file will not be in a browser context, GCL files must be cached explicitly server-side according to the cache-control headers.

Application logic must only request one version of the GCL during the cache period specified in the cache-control header. For example, if the caching period is one week, only one request for the current GCL file must be received per week.

Note: The volume of usage will be monitored carefully by the managing organisation (MO) and any organisations not adhering to this request limit will be blocked from accessing the GCL.

### Using a compressed version of the Global CMP List
A compressed version of the GCL must be requested. This can be done by sending Accept-Encoding headers on the GET request for the file:

- Example: Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate, br

     *  If present, CMP is considered deleted after this date/time and
     *  consent string or TC String must be discarded immediately.
