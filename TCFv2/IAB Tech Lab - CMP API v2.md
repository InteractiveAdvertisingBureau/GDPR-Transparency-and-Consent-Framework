## Introduction

This document is one of the IAB Europe Transparency and Consent Framework (TCF) Specifications. It defines the API for Consent Management Providers (CMPs). The CMP API v2 is the interface a CMP provides for callers (web and in-app) to access information regarding the transparency and consent disclosed and obtained from the end user by the CMP. Both required functionality that the CMP must provide and optional features are described.

The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) requires a high level of accountability for how personal data is processed for users consuming content online or in-app. Specifically, GDPR requires a legal basis for such processing. Two of the legal bases described in the GDPR are the most relevant to organizations that operate in the digital advertising ecosystem. Such organizations need to either obtain consent from the user to process their personal data, or establish legitimate interests for processing data such that the interests and fundamental rights of the user are not overriding.

Under the GDPR, controllers are required to create and maintain records of compliance. While compliance is important, implementation came with heavy technical challenges. Clear standards for a common technical solution would be needed.

IAB Europe established the TCF to support compliance with the GDPR in the context of digital advertising. This framework is built on four components: a Global Vendor List (GVL), a Transparency and Consent String (TC String) to store data, an API for CMPs to create and process the TC String, and the Policies that govern how the TCF is used.

Prescribed use of the TCF establishes an audit trail to help maintain compliance with the GDPR, but the real benefit to the digital advertising ecosystem is a safer Internet for consumers, and more reliable data for brands and publishers. As adoption of the TCF increases, compliance becomes more scalable and data becomes more meaningful.

To participate in the use of the TCF, become familiar with the Policies for using it. To have transparency and consent established and signaled  for your online services, apply to be added to the GVL. To play a role in creating a TC String for signaling status on transparency and user consent, sign up with IAB Europe to become a CMP. CMPs must follow technical standards provided in this document for creating TC Strings in compliance with [TCF Policy](https://iabeurope.eu/iab-europe-transparency-consent-framework-policies/). They must also follow technical standards  for using the CMP API specified in this document to receive and process information provided in the TC String.

### About the Transparency & Consent Framework

IAB Europe Transparency & Consent Framework (TCF) has a simple objective to help all parties in the digital advertising chain ensure that they comply with the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation and ePrivacy Directive when processing personal data or accessing and/or storing information on a user’s device, such as cookies, advertising identifiers, device identifiers and other tracking technologies. IAB Tech Lab stewards the development of these technical specifications.

## CMP API v2.0

### What does the CMP API support?

Consent Management Providers (CMPs) provide a user interface to establish transparency to users, and obtain consent or register objections from end users, and capture their preferences in Signals. These Signals are packaged in a standardized, easily-communicated payload called a TC String. The CMP API provides a standardized means for parties, such as the hosting publisher or an advertising vendor, to access these preferences managed by the CMP.

Using the API, scripts may obtain the TC String payload as well as the information it contains, which is ready to use without having to understand how to "unpack" the payload format. This makes it easy to make immediate data processing decisions based on the returned information.

CMPs may provide proprietary interfaces for specialised features or capabilities. The design and operation of a proprietary interface is documented in the IAB Europe Transparency and Consent Framework Policies.

This document specifies required functionality that the CMP must provide in accordance with the TCF. Any CMP functionality, including a publisher CMP or any UI and configuration, are provided by a designated CMP and using this CMP API. Other standardized APIs fall outside the TCF and may not be aligned to TCF policies.

### What is the Global Vendor List?

The Global Vendor List (GVL) is a technical document that CMPs download from a domain managed by IAB Europe. It lists all registered and approved Vendors, as well as standard Purposes, Features, Special Purposes, Special Features and Stacks. The information stored in the GVL is used for determining what legal disclosures must be made to the user. IAB Europe manages and publishes the GVL.

The Global Vendor List contains the following information:

*   A Global Vendor List version.
*   A list of standard Purposes, including any Special Purposes.
*   A list of standard Features. Vendors can indicate that they use Features. Since they span purposes, users cannot exercise choice  about any of them, but Features Vendors use should be disclosed  in the CMP’s UI.
*   A list of Special Features, which are Features for which users are given an opt-in choice.
*   A list of Stack definitions.
*   A list of Vendors with assigned Vendor IDs (denoted as **VendorIds** in the string), the standard Purposes for which they are requesting consent, the standard Purposes they will be using on the legitimate interest legal basis, the Features they may use across declared Purposes, and the URL of their GDPR/privacy policy page. _VendorIds_ are incrementally-assigned and not reused; deleted Vendors are just marked as deleted.
*   Vendor GET limits to inform overflow option. This provides the information needed to support Vendor’s ability to use the http GET request.

You can learn more about the Global Vendor list on the IAB EU website: [https://iabeurope.eu/tcf](https://iabeurope.eu/tcf)

### How does the CMP provide the API?

Every consent manager MUST provide the following API function:

**`__tcfapi(command, version, callback, parameter)`**

The function `__tcfapi` **must always be a function** and cannot be any other type, even if only temporarily on initialization – the API must be able to handle calls at all times.

Secondarily, CMPs must provide a proxy for postMessage events targeted to the `__tcfapi` interface sent from within nested iframes. See [the section on iframes](#how-can-vendors-that-use-iframes-call-the-cmp-api-from-an-iframe) for information.

### What required API commands must a CMP support?

All CMPs must support four required API commands: [`'getTCData'`](#gettcdata), [`'ping'`](#ping), [`'addEventListener'`](#addeventlistener) and [`'removeEventListener'`](#removeeventlistener).

______

#### `getTCData`

| argument name | type | optional | value |
|--:|:-:|:-:|:--|
| command | string | | `'getTCData'` |
| [version](#how-does-the-version-parameter-work) | number | | `2` |
| callback | function | | `function(tcData: TCData, success: boolean)` |
| parameter | int array | ✔️  | `vendorIds` |

**Example:**

```javascript
__tcfapi('getTCData', 2, (tcData, success) => {

  if(success) {

    // do something with tcData

  } else {

    // do something else

  }

}, [1,2,3]);
```

The `vendorIds` array contains the integer-value Vendor IDs for Vendors in which transparency and consent is being requested.

If the `vendorIds` argument is not defined the callback will be called with a [`TCData`](#tcdata) that includes Transparency and Consent values for all Vendors in the [Global Vendor List](#what-is-the-global-vendor-list).  If GDPR does not apply to this user in this context (`gdprApplies=false`) then this user will have no Transparency and Consent values and a TCData object with no Transparency and Consent values for any Vendors will be passed to the callback function. For more on `gdprApplies` see the section ["What does the gdprApplies value mean?"](#what-does-the-gdprapplies-value-mean).

The callback shall be called immediately and without any asynchronous logic with whatever is available in the current state of the CMP.  To determine the current state the callback will need to evaluate the [`eventStatus`](#addeventlistener) property value.  It is recommended that calling scripts register a listener function via [`addEventListener`](#addeventlistener) instead of `getTCData`, which also exposes a [`TCData`](#tcdata) object, to ensure necessary TC string and decoded TC values under the right circumstances and context for their legal basis as specified in [TCF Policy](https://iabeurope.eu/iab-europe-transparency-consent-framework-policies/). The consent and legitimate interest values will be `false` in the [`TCData`](#tcdata) object for any unregistered Vendor ID passed in the vendorIds array.  Which, in accordance with [TCF Policy](https://iabeurope.eu/iab-europe-transparency-consent-framework-policies/), means “No Consent” for _consent_ and “No Legitimate Interest Transparency Established” for _legitimate interest_.

A value of `false` will be passed as the argument to the `success` callback parameter if an invalid `vendorIds` argument is passed with this command. An invalid `vendorIds` argument would constitute anything other than an array of positive integers.

The `callback` shall be invoked only once per api call with this command.

______

#### `ping`

| argument name | type  | value |
|--:|:-:|:--|
| command | string | `'ping'` |
| [version](#how-does-the-version-parameter-work) | number | `2` |
| callback | function | `function(pingReturn: PingReturn)` |

**Example:**

```javascript
__tcfapi('ping', 2, (pingReturn) => {

  // do something with pingReturn

});
```

The ping command invokes the callback immediately without any asynchronous logic and returns a [`PingReturn`](#pingreturn) object for determining whether or not the main CMP script has loaded yet and whether GDPR applies; therefore, the only command required to be on the page in a stub before the rest of the commands are implemented. See the section ["What does the gdprApplies value mean?"](#what-does-the-gdprapplies-value-mean) for more.

The `callback` shall be invoked only once per api call with this command.

______

#### `addEventListener`

| argument name | type  | value |
|--:|:-:|:--|
| command | string | `'addEventListener'` |
| [version](#how-does-the-version-parameter-work) | number | `2` |
| callback | function | `function(tcData: TCData, success: boolean)` |

**Example:**

```javascript
const callback = (tcData, success) => {

  if(success && tcData.eventStatus === 'tcloaded') {

    // do something with tcData.tcString

    // remove the ourself to not get called more than once
    __tcfapi('removeEventListener', 2, (success) => {

      if(success) {

        // oh good...

      }

    }, tcData.listenerId);


  } else {

    // do something else

  }

}

__tcfapi('addEventListener', 2, callback);
```

Registers a callback function with a CMP (or a postmessage to respond to for cross-domain case). The callback will be invoked with the [`TCData`](#tcdata) object as an argument whenever the TC String is changed and a new one is available. The [`TCData`](#tcdata) object will contain CMP-assigned `listenerId` for the registered listener. The [`eventStatus`](#addeventlistener) property of the [`TCData`](#tcdata) object shall be one of the following:

| eventStatus | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `'tcloaded'` | This shall be the value for the `eventStatus` property of the [`TCData`](#tcdata) object when a CMP is loaded and is prepared to surface a TC String to any calling scripts on the page. A CMP is only prepared to surface a TC String for this `eventStatus` if an existing, <span style="text-decoration:underline;">valid</span> TC String is available to the CMP and it is not intending to surface the UI. If, however, the CMP will surface the UI because of an invalid TC String (e.g. it is too old, incorrect or does not reflect all the information the CMP needs to gather from the user) then an event with this `eventStatus` must not be triggered. |
| `'cmpuishown'` | This shall be the value for the `eventStatus` property of the [`TCData`](#tcdata) object any time the UI is surfaced or re-surfaced, a TC String is available and has rendered "Transparency" in accordance with the [TCF Policy](https://iabeurope.eu/iab-europe-transparency-consent-framework-policies/). The CMP shall create a TC string with all the surfaced vendors’ legitimate interest signals set to true and all the consent signals set to false.  If previous TC signals are present a CMP may also merge those into the now-available TC String in accordance with the policy. |
| `'useractioncomplete'` | This shall be the value for the `eventStatus` property of the [`TCData`](#tcdata) object whenever a user has confirmed or re-confirmed their choices in accordance with [TCF Policy](https://iabeurope.eu/iab-europe-transparency-consent-framework-policies/) and a CMP is prepared to respond to any calling scripts with the corresponding TC String. |

The CMP will, in most cases, invoke the callback when  either the `'tcloaded'` OR `'cmpuishown'` + `'useractioncomplete'` `eventStatus`(s) occur, but never for all three `eventStatuses` within the same page view. However, if an existing and valid TC string is available and the CMP does not intend to to surface a UI automatically (`'tcloaded'`) but the user manually surfaces the UI and changes their selected choices (`'cmpuishown'` + `'useractioncomplete'`) all three `eventStatuses` would appear within the same page view.

The callback shall be invoked with `false` as the argument for the `success` parameter if the callback could not be registered as a listener for any reason.

> **Note**: The `addEventListener` callback shall be immediately called upon registration with the current TC data, even if the CMP status is `loading` and the CMP has incomplete TC Data, so that the calling script may have access to its registered `listenerId`. Furthermore, on every TC String change the callback shall be called unless it is removed via `removeEventListener`.
______

#### `removeEventListener`

| argument name | type  | value |
|--:|:-:|:--|
| command | string | `'removeEventListener'` |
| [version](#how-does-the-version-parameter-work) | number | `2` |
| callback | function | `function(success: boolean)` |
| parameter | number | `listenerId`, the unique ID assigned by the CMP to the registered callback (via `addEventListener`) |

**Example:** see [`'addEventListener'`](#addeventlistener)

The callback shall be called with `false` as the argument for the `success` parameter if the listener could not be removed (e.g. the CMP cannot find a registered listener corresponding to `listenerId`).

______

### What optional API commands might a CMP support?

A CMP may choose to support two optional API commands: [`'getInAppTCData'`](#getinapptcdata) and [`'getVendorList'`](#getvendorlist).

______

#### `getInAppTCData`

| argument name | type  | value |
|--:|:-:|:--|
| command | string | `'getInAppTCData'` |
| [version](#how-does-the-version-parameter-work) | number | `2` |
| callback | function | `function(inAppTCData: InAppTCData, success: boolean)` |

**Example:**

```javascript
__tcfapi('getInAppTCData', 2, (inAppTCData, success) => {

  if(success) {

    // do something with inAppTCData

  } else {

    // do something else

  }

});
```

A mobile in-app CMP that uses a web-based UI in a mobile web view may choose to implement API calls with this command for the purpose of retrieving the TC String and pre-parsed TC signals from that web-based UI for the purpose of storing them in the [`NSUserDefaults`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nsuserdefaults#1664798?language=objc)(iOS) or [`SharedPreferences`](https://developer.android.com/training/data-storage/shared-preferences.html)(Android). (see [What is the CMP in-app internal structure for the defined API?](#what-is-the-cmp-in-app-internal-structure-for-the-defined-api))

The callback shall be invoked only once per api call with this command.

______

#### `getVendorList`

| argument name | type | optional | value |
|--:|:---:|:-:|:--|
| command | string | | `'getVendorList'` |
| [version](#how-does-the-version-parameter-work) | number | | `2` |
| callback | function | | `function(gvl: GlobalVendorList, success: boolean)` |
| parameter | int or string | ✔️  | `vendorListVersion` |

**Example:**

```javascript
__tcfapi('getVendorList', 2, (gvl, success) => {

  if(success) {

    // do something with gvl

  } else {

    // do something else

  }

}, 'LATEST');
```

Calling with this command and a valid `vendorListVersion` parameter shall return a `GlobalVendorList` object to the `callback` function.  The caller may specify a [Global Vendor List](#what-is-the-global-vendor-list) version number with the `vendorListVersion` parameter.  If no version is specified, the [Global Vendor List](#what-is-the-global-vendor-list) version returned shall be the same as that which is encoded in the current TC String – If no TC String exists the latest version of the [Global Vendor List](#what-is-the-global-vendor-list) shall be returned.  The calling function may also pass `'LATEST'` as the argument to the `vendorListVersion` parameter to explicitly receive the latest [Global Vendor List](#what-is-the-global-vendor-list) version as the `GlobalVendorList` object.

If an invalid `vendorListVersion` argument is passed with the `getVendorList` command the callback function shall receive a `null` argument for the `GlobalVendorList` parameter and the `success` parameter shall receive a `false` argument.  Valid `vendorListVersion`s are integers (or integer strings) greater than `1`.  The `success` parameter shall receive a `false` argument for any unsuccessful call with the `getVendorList` command. (eg. invalid `vendorListVersion` argument, network error, etc…)

The callback shall be invoked only once per api call with this command.

______

### What objects are returned from the API?

______

#### `TCData`

This object contains both the encoded and unencoded values of the TC String as well as information about the CMP `eventStatus` and whether or not GDPR applies to this user in this context (see the section ["What does the gdprApplies value mean?"](#what-does-the-gdprapplies-value-mean) for more).  If GDPR does not apply to this user in this context then only `gdprApplies`, `tcfPolicyVersion`, `cmpId` and `cmpVersion` shall exist in the object. If it is unknown just yet whether GDPR Applies to this user in this context or if this is CMP Stub code then the `callback` shall not be invoked until that `gdprApplies` is known.

``` javascript
TCData = {
  tcString: 'base64url-encoded TC string with segments',
  tcfPolicyVersion: 2,
  cmpId:1000,
  cmpVersion: 1000,

### In-App Details

#### How is a CMP used in-app?

The steps for integrating a CMP SDK into an app are the following:

1. An app publisher should embed a CMP SDK – The setup and configuration as well as the protocol for  how to initialize the CMP SDK  are all proprietary to each CMP SDK.
2. Since more than one CMP SDK may be included in publishers' linked SDKs, the publisher must initialize only one of them. The initialized CMP shall set `IABTCF_CmpSdkID` with its ID as soon as it is initialized in the app to signal to vendors that a CMP is present.
3. The CMP SDK will determine if GDPR applies (see the section ["What does the gdprApplies value mean?"](#what-does-the-gdprapplies-value-mean)) to this user in this context. But, a publisher may choose to initialize a CMP dialogue UI manually.
4. The CMP shall set the [`NSUserDefaults`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nsuserdefaults#1664798?language=objc)(iOS) or [`SharedPreferences`](https://developer.android.com/training/data-storage/shared-preferences.html)(Android) variables and vendors will then be able to read from them directly.
5. Vendors should listen to `IABTCF_* `key updates to retrieve new TC data from [`NSUserDefaults`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nsuserdefaults#1664798?language=objc)(iOS) or [`SharedPreferences`](https://developer.android.com/training/data-storage/shared-preferences.html)(Android).

#### What is the CMP in-app internal structure for the defined API?

[`NSUserDefaults`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nsuserdefaults#1664798?language=objc)(iOS) or [`SharedPreferences`](https://developer.android.com/training/data-storage/shared-preferences.html)(Android) shall be used to store pre-parsed TC data as well as the TC string by a CMP SDK. It allows:

*   Vendors to easily access TC data
*   TC data to persist across app sessions
*   TC data to be portable between CMPs to provide flexibility for a publisher to exchange one CMP SDK for another
*   Vendors within an app to avoid code duplication by not being required to include a TC string decoder while still enabling all typical use cases

**Note:** If a publisher chooses to remove a CMP SDK from their app they are responsible for clearing all `IABTCF_*` vestigial values for users so that vendors do not continue to use the TC data therein.

[`NSUserDefaults`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nsuserdefaults#1664798?language=objc)(iOS) or [`SharedPreferences`](https://developer.android.com/training/data-storage/shared-preferences.html)(Android) values

#### How do third-party SDKs (vendors) access the consent information in-app?

On both Android OS and iOS, the vendor can get notified when the values of the shared keys change. See [NSUserDefaultsDidChangeNotification](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nsuserdefaultsdidchangenotification?language=objc) and [SharedPreferences.OnSharedPreferenceChangeListener](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/SharedPreferences.OnSharedPreferenceChangeListener.html).

On Android OS, the TC data and TC string shall be stored in the default Shared Preferences for the application context. This can be accessed using the `getDefaultSharedPreferences` method from the `android.preference.PreferenceManager` class using the application context.

**Example**:

```java
Context mContext = getApplicationContext();
SharedPreferences mPreferences = PreferenceManager.getDefaultSharedPreferences(mContext);
```
The TC data values can be retrieved from the application Shared Preferences by key name using the `get` methods on the `android.content.SharedPreferences` class. For the purposes of accessing TC data, only two methods should be necessary: `getString(String key, String defValue)` for `String` values and `getInt(String key, int defValue)` for `integer`s and `integer` representations of `Boolean` values.

**Example**:

```java
Context mContext = getApplicationContext();
SharedPreferences mPreferences = PreferenceManager.getDefaultSharedPreferences(mContext);
String consentString = mPreferences.getString("IABTCF_TCString", "");
int gdprApplies = mPreferences.getInt("IABTCF_gdprApplies", "");
```
A callback can be registered to update settings when a preference is changed using the `registerOnSharedPreferenceChangeListener` method for the `android.content.SharedPreferences` class.

**Note**: The preference manager does not currently store a strong reference to the listener. If you do not store a strong reference, the listener will be susceptible to garbage collection. External guidance such as this [documentation on setting listeners](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/settings#Listening) may provide more information on listening for preference changes.

**Example**:

```java
Context mContext = getApplicationContext();
SharedPreferences mPreferences = PreferenceManager.getDefaultSharedPreferences(mContext);
SharedPreferences.OnSharedPreferenceChangeListener mListener;
mListener = new SharedPreferences.OnSharedPreferenceChangeListener() {
            public void onSharedPreferenceChanged(SharedPreferences preferences, String key) {
                        if (key.equals([Specific Consent Key])) {
                                   // Update Consent settings
                                   }
                        }
            };


mPreferences.registerOnSharedPreferenceChangeListener(mListener);
```
#### How does ad mediation work in-app?

Mediation SDK allows app developers to monetize from multiple vendors.

##### Mediation SDK

*   Mediation SDK retrieves `IABTCF_gdprApplies` and `IABTCF_TCString` from [`NSUserDefaults`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nsuserdefaults#1664798?language=objc)(iOS) or [`SharedPreferences`](https://developer.android.com/training/data-storage/shared-preferences.html)(Android).
*   If `IABTCF_gdprApplies == 0`, Mediation SDK can run mediation across all ad network SDKs.
*   If `IABTCF_gdprApplies == 1`, Mediation SDK will run mediation only among the ad network SDKs that are GDPR ready.

'GDPR ready' means that the vendor retrieves `IABTCF_gdprApplies` and `IABTCF_TCString` from [`NSUserDefaults`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nsuserdefaults#1664798?language=objc)(iOS) or [`SharedPreferences`](https://developer.android.com/training/data-storage/shared-preferences.html)(Android), and passes on these GDPR values downstream.

##### Vendor

*   Vendor retrieves `IABTCF_gdprApplies` and `IABTCF_TCString` from [`NSUserDefaults`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nsuserdefaults#1664798?language=objc)(iOS) or [`SharedPreferences`](https://developer.android.com/training/data-storage/shared-preferences.html)(Android), and passes on these GDPR values downstream and passes on these GDPR values downstream.

## Using the CMP API

The following details provide information about how ad tags work, using the version parameter in the `__tcfapi()` function, and how vendors can interact with the API.

### How do ad tags work?

Tag-based demand, especially ad tags, are basically creative files, that are not an advertisement themselves, but are loaded to access additional sources to provide ad creative.

For performance reasons, the preferred way to make this happen in current ad servers are macros. The following two macros are recommended for ad server implementation:

| Macro | Values |
| :-- | :-- |
| `${GDPR}`| <p>**1** - GDPR Applies</p><p>**0** - GDPR does not apply</p><p>**unset** - unknown</p> |
| `${GDPR_CONSENT_XXXX}`| Encoded TC String where XXXX is the numeric Vendor ID of the vendor receiving the TC string. |

**Note**: Values align with IAB OpenRTB GDPR Advisory

**Note**: For more information on GDPR Applies see the section ["What does the gdprApplies value mean?"](#what-does-the-gdprapplies-value-mean)

### How does the "version" parameter work?

The `Version` parameter of the API is used to enable scripts to specify what version of the API they are prepared to handle. The CMP shall respond in kind with the appropriately versioned information, if available.

If the argument is `0` (Zero), `null` or `undefined`, the CMP shall return the information for the latest (highest) version available. For example, when a user has a v2 TC string and a v3 TC string, the CMP should return the v3 TC string and TC data.

If the argument is invalid (i.e. not a positive integer greater than `1` or higher than the highest supported version for this CMP) the CMP shall invoke the callback with an argument of `false` for the success parameter and a `null` argument for any expected TC data parameter.

If the argument is `1`, the CMP shall invoke the callback with an argument of `false` for the success parameter and a `null` argument for any expected TC data parameter, as this TCF version is no longer supported by this API. Vendors should instead use the version `1` API to get version `1` data (see [v1.1 documentation](https://github.com/InteractiveAdvertisingBureau/GDPR-Transparency-and-Consent-Framework/blob/master/CMP%20JS%20API%20v1.1%20Final.md#consent-management-provider-javascript-api-v11-transparency--consent-framework)).

If the argument is an integer higher than `1`, the CMP shall invoke the callback with defined data according to the specified version if it exists in that version.  For obvious reasons, if new properties of the version-specific outlined TC data objects are added in v3, a v2 TC data object shall not contain these new properties because they may either not exist or may have different meaning from version to version.

### What does the gdprApplies value mean?

`gdprApplies` is a `boolean` value that may be `undefined`.  A CMP shall determine whether or not GDPR applies in its current context and set the `gdprApplies` value.  A publisher may determine that GDPR applies to all traffic on their site and signal their CMP to always return `true` for `gdprApplies`, a CMP may invoke a geo-tagging service call to make a determination on a specific user or may have some other proprietary solution for determining whether or not GDPR applies in accordance with [TCF Policy](https://iabeurope.eu/iab-europe-transparency-consent-framework-policies/).  In any case, vendors shall respect the value of `gdprApplies` put forth by the CMP.  If `gdprApplies` value is `undefined` but exists in the schema outlined in the response object in this document, then calling scripts shall assume that the CMP is still pending a determination on whether or not GDPR applies in this context.

### Details for vendors

#### How can scripts on a page determine if there is a CMP present?

Scripts can check for the presence of a function named `__tcfapi` – if it exists then a CMP can be assumed to be present for scripts.  In iframes, the presence of a CMP can be determined by the existence of a specially-named iframe named `"__tcfapiLocator"` in the parent (or above) frame. The CMP shall create an iframe as a signal to scripts nested in other iframes that a CMP exists in a higher frame and name it `"__tcfapiLocator"` on the current `DOM` to indicate its own presence; since iframe properties can be accessed from other iframes. Publishers must load the CMP in a parent (or ancestor) of all iframes that may need to establish a GDPR legal basis.

If a CMP is not present, or if the CMP fails to respond, vendors should assume "no consent" and “no legitimate interest transparency established” in contexts where GDPR applies (see the section ["What does the gdprApplies value mean?"](#what-does-the-gdprapplies-value-mean) for more).

#### How can scripts determine if the CMP script is loaded yet?

Typically, scripts will not need to check if the CMP script is loaded. Scripts can simply call the `__tcfapi` function as it will queue the calls for execution when the full CMP script is loaded.  If the full CMP has been loaded, its `__tcfapi` implementation will handle the call normally. If necessary, the [`'ping'`](#ping) command will return a [`PingReturn`](#pingreturn) object that contains the `boolean` property `cmpLoaded` to indicate whether the cmp is loaded.

#### How does the CMP "stub" API work?

1. A CMP-provided synchronous "stub" script must be added by the publisher to their page before any other scripts that rely on `__tcfapi` (this usually means between the `<head></head>` tags of the HTML document).
2. This "stub" will:
    1. Define a queuing function named `__tcfapi` at the `Window` scope.
    2. All arguments for a given call to the stubbed `__tcfapi` method will be enqueued as a set.
    3. Define the postMessage handler function for cross-origin iframe requests.
    4. Add the newly-created `postMessage` handler function as an event listener on the `Window` object listening for the `‘message’` event.
    5. Create an iframe named `'__tcfapiLocator'` in the current DOM.
3. When the main CMP implementation script loads and executes, it will:
    1. Create an internal reference to the queued argument sets of the "stub".
    2. Redefine the `__tcfapi` function to the CMP’s full API implementation.
    3. Iterate and dequeue the queued argument sets in a first-in-first-out (FIFO) order and `apply` each set of arguments to the fully-implemented `__tcfapi` function.

#### Requirements for the CMP "stub" API script

A CMP must provide stub script to its clients that at least supports the following features/logic:

1. `__tcfapi` function that supports the ping command, with the minimum properties of `cmpLoaded` and `apiVersion`. **Note**: `gdprApplies` may also be set in the [`PingReturn`](#pingreturn) object if the "stub" is set by the publisher to apply GDPR to all traffic.  However, `gdprApplies` may not be available until the CMP is finished loading and the value will, therefore, be `undefined`. See the section ["What does the gdprApplies value mean?"](#what-does-the-gdprapplies-value-mean) for more.
2. Collect all calls to `__tcfapi` that cannot (yet) be handled by the “stub” in a queue
3. Check if `window.frames['__tcfapiLocator']` exists, indicating that a CMP is already present, otherwise create an empty iframe named `'__tcfapiLocator`' in the current DOM.
4. Create an event listener for `postMessage` events on the `Window` object. When the event handler function receives a postMessage (`‘message’`) event it shall proxy the `__tcfapi` function requests to send the response back through the `postMessage` event channel
5. The stub code must be loaded and executed synchronously before any other scripts that depend on the `__tcfapi` function to be there – this usually means between the `<head></head>` tags of the HTML document – in order to ensure that it can be executed before all calls from third parties.

#### Is there a sample CMP “stub” API script?

You can find an iab-supported open-source implementation of the stub API here: https://github.com/InteractiveAdvertisingBureau/iabtcf-es/blob/master/modules/stub/

This code should be executed on the page before any other scripts that require the `__tcfapi` function – this usually means between the `<head></head>` tags of the HTML document. The sample script also includes the `postMessage` handler.


### How can vendors that use iframes call the CMP API from an iframe?

The only way to request TC Data from a parent or ancestor’s frame is [using postmessage](#using-postmessage).

#### Using postmessage

The [`window.postMessage()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/postMessage) method may be used from a child iframe to make requests from a parent or any ancestor frame's CMP API. To locate an ancestor frame capable of responding to `postMessage()` CMP API calls, search for an ancestor frame that has a child frame named `'__tcfapiLocator'` (see [sample code](#is-there-a-sample-iframe-script-call-to-the-cmp-api)).

CMPs shall create an event listener to handle `postMessage` requests via the [CMP “stub” API script](#how-does-the-cmp-stub-api-work) so that `postMessage` events can be queued and processed by the full-implementation of the CMP API as soon as it is initialized.

**Sent Message**

The sent message shall follow the form outlined below. The command, parameter and version object properties correspond to their namesake parameters defined as method argument parameters for `__tcfapi()` method. The “sent message” also requires a unique callId property to help match the request with a response. The `callId` property shall be either a string or a number, but the calling script shall not use the two types interchangeably.

```javascript
{
  __tcfapiCall: {
    command: "command",
    parameter: parameter,
    version: version
  }
}
```

The `event.data` object payload shall follow the form outlined below. The `returnValue` object property shall be the corresponding TC data object for the `command` used upon sending the “sent message”. The `success` object property shall reflect the `__tcfapi()` `success` callback argument and the `callId` will correspond to the “sent message” unique id passed in the `callId` property.

```javascript
{
  __tcfapiReturn: {
   returnValue: returnValue,
   success: boolean,
   callId: uniqueId
  }
}
```

#### Is there a sample iframe script call to the CMP API?

Below is an example script that emulates the in-frame `__tcfapi()` call. It locates the ancestor frame running the CMP, performs the `postMessage` and listens for the return message and passes its values to the callback:

```javascript
(function() {

  //start here at our window
  let frame = window;

  // if we locate the CMP iframe we will reference it with this
  let cmpFrame;

  // map of calls
  const cmpCallbacks = {};

  while(frame) {

    try {

      /**
       * throws a reference error if no frames exist
       */

      if (frame.frames['__tcfapiLocator']) {

        cmpFrame = frame;
        break;

      }

    } catch(ignore) {}

    if(frame === window.top) {

      break;

    }

    frame = frame.parent;

  }

 /**
  * Set up a __tcfapi proxy method to do the postMessage and map the callback.
  * From the caller's perspective, this function behaves identically to the
  * CMP API's __tcfapi call
  */

  window.__tcfapi = function(cmd, version, callback, arg) {

    if (!cmpFrame) {

      callback({msg: 'CMP not found'}, false);

    } else {

      const callId = Math.random() + '';
      const msg = {
        __tcfapiCall: {
          command: cmd,
          parameter: arg,
          version: version,
          callId: callId,
        },
      };

      /**
       * map the callback for lookup on response
       */

      cmpCallbacks[callId] = callback;
      cmpFrame.postMessage(msg, '*');

    }

  };

  function postMessageHandler(event) {

  /**
    * when we get the return message, call the mapped callback
    */

    let json = {};

    try {

      /**
        * if this isn't valid JSON then this will throw an error
        */

      json = typeof event.data === 'string' ? JSON.parse(event.data) : event.data;

    } catch (ignore) {}

    const payload = json.__tcfapiReturn;

    if (payload) {

      /**
        * messages we care about will have a payload
        */

      if (typeof cmpCallbacks[payload.callId] === 'function') {

        /**
         * call the mapped callback and then remove the reference
         */

        cmpCallbacks[payload.callId](payload.returnValue, payload.success);
        cmpCallbacks[payload.callId] = null;

      }

    }

  }

  window.addEventListener('message', postMessageHandler, false);

}());

__tcfapi('ping', 2, (pingReturn, success) => {

  // should get response from window.top's CMP

});
```
### From where will the API retrieve the TC string?

See the ‘How should the transparency & consent string be stored?’ section in the ‘Transparency & Consent String and Global Vendor List Format’ spec which describes where CMPs must store the transparency & consent string.

#### How will the API prioritize the service-specific and the global configurations?

The service-specific TC String will override the global TC String, if it is being used. The prioritization between these two scenarios is as specified in the policy FAQ.
