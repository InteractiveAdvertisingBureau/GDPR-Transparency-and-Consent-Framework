# GDPR Transparency and Consent Framework
Hosted in this repository are the technical specifications for IAB Europe Transparency and Consent Framework that will help the digital advertising industry interpret and comply with EU rules on data protection and privacy - notably the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) that comes into effect on May 25, 2018. 

#### IAB Europe Transparency and Consent Framework 

In November 2017, IAB Europe and a cross-section of the publishing and advertising industry, announced a new Transparency & Consent Framework to help publishers, advertisers and technology companies comply with key elements of GDPR. The Framework will give the publishing and advertising industries a common language with which to communicate consumer consent for the delivery of relevant online advertising and content. IAB Tech Lab is charged with the technical governance of these specifications. 

Specifications published here support the Framework, including the following v1.1 final specifications ready for industry adoption: 
* Consent Management Provider JavaScript API v1.1 Final (referred to as CMP JS API v1.1) 
* Consent string and vendor list formats v1.1 Final

Upcoming final release of:
* pubvendors.json v1.0
* Mobile In-App CMP API v1.0

Please submit any general feedback to feedback@advertisingconsent.eu and any technical feedback to transparencyframework@iabtechlab.com.
